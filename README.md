[Try out demo on Heroku](https://young-stream-5505.herokuapp.com/#/todo).

**Keep in mind, that files you upload (comments attachments), will be deleted in a short term, or will not be saved at all, if they are large, because of Heroku file system settings, and you probably may not download these files.**

**I recommend using small txt files for testing uploading and downloading.**

To run tests just run (you need installed firefox in your system)
```
rake spec
```
There are 112 tests at the moment
